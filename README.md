# DistractionDetox
- Personalized app to prevent students from being distracted from their work and studies
- Submission for MLDA Deep Learning Week 2024
- Made using Python TTS, Tkinter and Gemini Pro Vision API

# How it works
- User inputs his/her desired task such as studying a certain subject or completing a certain assignment.
- App will periodically take screenshots on the user's screen and ask Gemini if the user is distracted and if so, generate a message to taunt the user about what he/she is currently doing on screen.
- The taunt message will be converted into speech which the user will then hear while being distracted.

# How to use
- Just download the executable file in the releases section and run it!
- At the starting screen, simply type the task you want to accomplish for the day, and just let it run in the background.
- This app uses audio to generate personalized messages, so be sure to turn your sound on!
- Try not to get distracted from your task. Good luck!
- DO NOT DO ANY SENSITIVE TASKS SUCH AS ONLINE BANKING FOR EXAMPLE. This app does not collect any data from tge user as the screenshot will be saved in the user's folder directory that has the app in it, however the screenshots are still passed into Gemini's database.
